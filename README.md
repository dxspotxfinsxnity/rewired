# Rewired

A lightweight, declarative framework for the web that **connects data and markup
directly** with JSX. Using **observable‑based reactivity**, it keeps the **DOM**
in sync, **updates only what changes** in a **fine‑grained** manner, and
supports **two‑way binding** and clean **event handling** through **event
delegation**. Built for **TypeScript**, it delivers **interactive** UIs without
a virtual DOM, making the development of modern web **UI** straightforward and
reactive.
